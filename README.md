stRange.js
==========
[![NPM version][npm-badge]](http://badge.fury.io/js/strange)
[npm-badge]: https://badge.fury.io/js/strange.png

stRange.js is a **range object** for JavaScript. It doesn't currently do
anything beyond allowing you to construct it with a beginning and an end, but it
will eventually support both **exclusive and inclusive ranges** and **infinite
ranges**.


Installing
----------
**Note**: stRange.js will follow the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)
starting from v1.0.0.

### Installing on Node.js
```
npm install strange
```

### Installing for the browser
stRange.js doesn't yet have a build ready for the browser, but you might be able
to use [Browserify][browserify] to have it run there till then.

Using
-----
Create a Range object by passing in a beginning and end:
```javascript
var Range = require("strange")
var range = new Range(1, 5)
```

Check if something is a range and use it:
```javascript
var Range = require("strange")
if (range instanceof Range) console.log(range.begin, range.end)
```
